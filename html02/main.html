        <p>
          Hi everyone, I am Zan Barinov. I am photos editor and filmmaker. I
          haven't got a lot of works in my portfolio but i have some. I started
          filming width stop-motion Lego cartoons. After that I filmed one short
          movie with my friends. We were filming it, while we were traveling on
          bikes around Gotland. Than I learned a lot about post production and
          learned how to use programs like Adobe Premiere Pro. Passed a lot of
          time before I knew about film light, camera movement, video color
          correction, 3d modelling, tracking, and so-on. Also I learned Adobe
          After Effects and now I can do everything with my videos.
